# Doodle Jump Pro

This is a new version of Doodle Jump where user can interact with game board using hand gestures. For example, if you move your hand to the right, the doodle will move right, etc. We also included a new mode where users can create their own board by clenching their fists where they want to place blocks to jump on. We used a Leap Motion sensor to track hand movement and used Pythonâ€™s Tkinter for the animation framework.
